                        A car (or automobile) is a wheeled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle" >motor vehicle </a> used for transportation. <br>
                        Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.

                        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propulsion#Vehicular_propulsion">vehicle propulsion </a> is provided by an engine or motor, 
                        usually an internal combustion engine or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor">electric motor </a>, or some combination of the two, such as hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

                        Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
                        Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.
                        In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[6]

                    <h2>  Etymology </h2>
                    <p id ="Etymology"> 
                        The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled cart," 
                        both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot."[16][17] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.
                        "Motor car," attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English.[3] "Autocar," a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning "self-propelled car," 
                        is now considered archaic.[20] "Horseless carriage" is attested from 1895.
                        "Automobile," a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek autós (αὐτός) "self" and Latin mobilis "movable," entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.[22] It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America,[23] where the abbreviated form "auto" commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like "auto industry" and "auto mechanic".
                        Both forms are still used in everyday Dutch (auto/automobiel) and German (Auto/Automobil)

                    <h2>  History </h2>
                    <p id ="history"> 
                        The first working steam-powered vehicle was designed—and quite possibly built—by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre (26 in)-long scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[13][26][27] It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.[27]

                        ot's 1771 fardier à vapeur, as preserved at the Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris, France
                        Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; 
                        he created a steam-powered tricycle. He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.
                        His inventions were, however, handicapped by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure. In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.

                        The development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars. 
                        A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. 
                        In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the LocCugnomotive Acts of 1865.

                        In 1807, Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore), but they chose to install it in a boat on the river Saone in France.
                        Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own 'de Rivaz internal combustion engine' and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Niépces' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[30] Neither design was very successful,
                        as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.[1]

                        Fully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), but have a long way to go before they are in general use

                    <p id="Open source development">
                        There have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design, an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared, often without monetary compensation. None of the projects have succeeded in developing a car as a whole including both hardware and software, and no mass production ready open-source based designs have been introduced. 
                        Some car hacking through on-board diagnostics (OBD) has been done so far.

                    <h3> Car sharing </h3>
                    <p id="Car Shring">
                        Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe.[99] For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007.
                        Services like car sharing offering a residents to "share" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighborhoods

                    <p id ="Industry"> 
                        Established alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transport such as buses, trolleybuses, trains, subways, tramways, light rail, cycling, and walking. Bicycle sharing systems have been established in China and many European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programs have been developed in large US cities.
                        Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted

                        The term motorcar was formerly also used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage.
                        These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems..
